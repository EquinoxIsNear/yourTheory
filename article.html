			  <h3>OVERVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE AND STUDY</h3>
			  <p><strong>FOREIGN LITERATURE</strong></p>
			  <p>College and university leaders hesitate to use digital games at the postsecondary level because of insufficient data on learning outcomes, assessments, and academic performance directly linked to digital game-based interventions (Kanthan & Senger, 2011; Vandercruysse, Vandewaetere, Cornillie, & Clarebout, 2013).</p>
			  <p>According to Ronaldo Tumbokon that in strategy games, for instance, while developing a city, an unexpected surprise like an enemy might emerge.  This forces the player to be flexible and quickly change tactics. Cognitive researcher Daphne Bavalier talks about how video games can help us learn focus and, fascinatingly, multitask. Video games are frowned upon by parents as timewasters, and worse, some education experts think that these games corrupt the brain.  Playing violent video games are easily blamed by the media and some experts as the reason why some young people become violent or commit extreme anti-social behavior.  But many scientists and psychologists find that video games can actually have many benefits – the main one is making kids smart.  Video games may actually teach kids high-level thinking skills that they will need in the future.</p>
			  <p>According to University of Wisconsin psychologist C. Shawn Green.“Video games change your brain,” Playing video games change the brain’s physical structure the same way as do learning to read, playing the piano, or navigating using a map. Much like exercise can build muscle, the powerful combination of concentration and rewarding surges of neurotransmitters like dopamine strengthen neural circuits that can build the brain.</p>
			  <p>According to UVP (Utah Valley Pediatrics)that Video games have been shown to help us improve our ability to reason and solve problems. They help us make split-second decisions, process information more quickly, and multitask effectively. Games can also improve hand-eye coordination and boost auditory perception.</p>
			  <p>According to Gwen Dewar, PH.D. (2018) The best way to understand the effects of video games on school performance is to conduct randomized, controlled experiments. “As I’ve already noted, these are in short supply”. But one exception is a small experiment conducted by Robert Weis and Brittany Cerankosky. Four months after the study began, the researchers examined the boys’ academic performance at school. And they found evidence of an effect.</p>
			  <p><strong>LOCAL LITERATURE</strong></p>
			  <p>According to PUP (Polytechnic University of the Philippines)Playing online games do not affect their grades badly as they know how to limit themselves. Many teenager students in the Philippines love to play online games, it is up to them if they can handle their time in playing in order to maintain their performance in the new normal education.</p>
			  <p>Vinluan (2016) stated thatComputer gaming is one of the fast-developingsectors of thisgeneration of computer technology. Computer games offer theirpatrons with a new dimension ofvirtual entertainment. The youth especially,college students are the usual patrons of computergames. According to NIKOMedia Research (2017), the projected number of online gamers in thePhilippines rose from 21 million in 2012 to 28.72 million in 2014. Meanwhile,statistics fromJuha Sompinmaki of Tech in Asia show that about 409, of thegaming population of thePhilippines is aged 18-24 years old.Furthermore, many multiplayer games such as DOTA orDefense of theAncients and LOL or League of Legends involve cooperation with otheronlineplayers in order o win. These games encourage players to make the most oftheir individualskills to contribute to the team</p>
			  <p>Our gadgets serve as an instrument for our new way of learning. However, learning independently through the guide of computers and internet contents might expose the learners to a lot of unwarranted distractions (Edwin M. Toralba, 2020).</p>
			  <p>According to Jason Murdock, (2018)"We found only very small effects on grades and none on actual competencies," Gnambs said following the publication of a study he co-authored, published in Psychology of Popular Media Culture. The academic noted there were "negligible effects of the time spent on computer games on grades or competence development." Students were followed over a period of two-years, the team said. This filled a gap in some prior research, which reportedly failed to analyze changes in academic performance over time. Not all research aligns, however. National Children's Bureau Northern Ireland, in their study title ICT and Me, suggested that kids who gamed less than once a week "were more successful in school than those who played twice a day or more."</p>
			  <p><strong>LOCAL STUDIES</strong></p>
			  <p>Dumrique, Dennis O., and Jennifer G. Castillo (2018)."Online Gaming: Impact on the academic performance and social behavior of the students in Polytechnic University of the Philippines Laboratory High School." KnE Social Sciences his ponder was conducted to evaluate and discover out the effects of on-line gaming on the scholastic execution and social behavior of the understudies within the school. Besides, this consider looked for answers on the noteworthy relationship between playing online diversions and scholarly execution and to social behavior of the understudies. The ponder uncovered those boys are more of a player compared to young ladies who frequently play diversions that require three or more players. Playing online recreations do not affect their grades severely for they know how to restrain themselves. They know that they must be control themselves in arrange to operate well in their course that's why they as it were.</p>
			  <p>According to Dennis O. Dumrique (2017)The study revealed that boys are more of a player compared to girls who often play games that require three or more players like valorant, etc. It is also stated that those who play online games are around 14-15 years old who are believed to be in the Grade 8 level. These students who often play games have an average weekly allowance of 101 pesos to 500 pesos. Playing online games do not affect their grades badly for they know how to limit themselves. They know that they need to control themselves in order to function well in their class that is why they only play games during vacation and weekends with a lot of time compared when they have classes. Even though they play online games; they know how to socialize well and they can perform very well when it comes to academic performance. However, it is inevitable not to play even for half an hour especially when they are accustomed to it. Therefore, it is just a matter of discipline.</p>
			  <p>According to Jennifer G. Castillo (2017) All these technologies are very good at distracting people. In line with this development, online gaming was created to give entertainment to people. Online gaming is one of the widely used leisure activities by many people. For some people it is said that playing video games has a number of reasons to be played, for it can be a stress reliever, challenge and competition, relaxation, enjoyment, social interaction, and even mentally escaping from the real world. For most people, on-line gaming is one of the best past times that they acquire specially for teenagers, youngsters and students.</p>
			  <p>Fabito, Bernie S., (2018)"Exploring mobile game addiction, cyberbullying, and its effects on academic performance among tertiary students in one university in the philippines."Portable gaming habit could be a developing concern that increments the user's chance for physical and mental wellbeing issues. Video diversion compulsion is portion of the so-called Web Gaming Clutter (IGD) and is regularly related with Betting Compulsion. In common, IGD has been connected to a poorer scholastic execution of understudies in instructive teach. In any case, a ponder conducted by Samaha and Hawi (2016) uncovered that there is no relationship between smartphone habit hazard and scholastic execution. This indicates a dissimilarity on the result of scholastic execution between IGD and portable phone compulsion.</p>
			  <p>lastly, in the study of Ocampo (2017)This study implied that narcissism could be a hazard calculate among the respondents that affects their spent time playing games. The respondents that taken an interest in this consider are female, plays online diversions for the final 6 months, and lives in BF Homes Paranaque City, Philippines. The comes about appeared that the respondents have low levels of hostility and narcissism and average levels of self-esteem and life-satisfaction.</p>
			  <p><strong>FOREIGN STUDIES</strong></p>
			  <p>According to Professor Lia Nower, (2021)also from the Center for Gambling Studies and Renmin University of China, the team examined data from the China Education Panel Survey. The national report provided information on school performance and recreational habits for nearly 10,000 students with an average age of 13.5. The survey results reveal children using digital technology for entertainment over four hours a day were four times more likely to skip class. Researchers discovered boys are much more likely to entertain themselves using social media, the internet, and video games than girls. In turn, boys also performed worse and displayed less desire to engage in their schoolwork than girls.</p>
			  <p>According to the Researchers at Rutgers University (2021)say children in middle school who play video games or use social media and the internet for more than an hour on school days have significantly lower grades and test scores than their peers. Study authors add their findings give parents some tangible boundaries for their kids when it comes to digital entertainment. They recommend limiting students to one hour of recreational screen time daily on weekdays and four hours a day on weekends.</p>
			  <p>According to Kuss & Griffiths (2017)teens who play online games are just having fun. They do not just actually play because of some sort of seriousness, but also because they just want to feel relief. During school hours, students tend to feel stressed due to loads of school works and through playing it will relive their stress. It is undeniably questionable that playing online games provide them something that no one can give. According to some researches it is beneficial. It enables the mind of the players to be more active, especially those puzzle-based games. Furthermore, it helps the player to come up with decisions in tight situations, especially those adventure games that keep the players to be alert, active and strategic. Students' learning takes place unexpectedly, but the inappropriate usage of playing online games also leads in some problems such as being distracted in school. Further, it is where the attention of the child was divided that even their health and social life is unknowingly affected. Several studies in psychology have found out that increased time spent on the Internet can lead to negative impact on a person's ability to communicate appropriately face-to-face with friends, peers, family members including parents.</p>
			  <p>According to Dr.Xunyi Wang (2021)This study provides practical implications and strategies to address the alarming increase in online gaming addiction (OGA). First, families, communities, and universities should encourage outdoor activities, such as sports competitions, and offline cosplay games to address the need for achievement and escapism. Second, individuals who play online games for relaxation should choose a relatively easy or hard mode to avoid game addiction. Finally, parents, teachers, and employers are encouraged to pay attention to individuals who have a high level of primary control since they can be susceptible to OGA. This study provides several theoretical contributions. First, the study enriches OGA and the gaming motivation literature by exploring the roles of gaming motivation, psychological ownership, and personal control strategies as they can be a factor in OGA. In addition, this study is the first to investigate the dark side of psychological ownership in terms of negative outcomes for OGA. This study also advances the personal control strategy literature by understanding the roles of primary and secondary control on OGA.</p>
			  <p>Jin Liang Wang (2019)With the fast development of mobile technology, many functions of desktop computers have been transferred to mobile devices like ipad and smartphone, which is especially the case for game applications. Mobile video games refer to games played by either single or multi players via online mobile devices. These games are particularly popular when they can be downloaded for free (e.g., “freemium games,” which are free but customers pay for extra features). The latest China Internet Network Information Center's (CNNIC) report revealed that the growth rate of mobile online game has reached 9.6% and adolescents are the main user group. In comparison with most segments of society, adolescents are more vulnerable to Internet-related addiction because of their psychological and developmental characteristics, the easy access to Internet with a portable device, and the positive expectation of mobile gaming. It has been demonstrated that video game addicts suffered poorer mental health and cognitive functioning, and increased emotional difficulties, such as enhanced depression and anxiety, as well as more social isolation. Despite this, relatively few studies have examined the relationship between mobile game addiction and mental health outcomes. This is because, so far, no measurement especially designed for mobile game addiction has been developed. In literature, problematic mobile video gaming has been defined as a phenomenon in which users strongly rely on mobile games and cannot help playing them repeatedly over a comparatively long period. Previous studies of Internet gaming disorder (IGD) have mainly focused on traditional online gaming addiction based on a desktop computer. However, recent research has suggested that there were only moderate correlations between the different forms of Internet addiction. In addition, although mobile game addiction has some similarity with traditional desktop computer online game addiction, there are still obvious differences.</p>

			  <h3>METHODOLOGY</h3>
			  <p><strong>RESEARCH DESIGN</strong></p>
			  <p>The researchers will use correlation research for this type of research design as it attempts to know the degree between two variables that are “The length of time playing valorant” and the “academic performance” of the students.</p>
			  <p>A correlational research design has been chosen for this research because the researchers want to know how much is the length of time they play valorant and is it the length of time playing valorant affects the academic performance of the students.</p>
			  <p><strong>RESEARCH LOCALE</strong></p>
			  <p>The study took place at the respective homes of the researchers at the las pinas. Las pinas is situated in southern metro manila, las pinas is a 1st class highly urbanized city in the National Capital Region of the Philippines. It has a population of 606,293 people.</p>
			  <p><strong>POPULATION AND SAMPLING</strong></p>
			  <p>The researchers utilized a non-probability sampling, not all members of the senior high school population for 1st semester of the school year 2021-2022 are given a chance of being selected as samples, as for those who only play valorant are chosen. Particularly, the researchers will use convenient sampling, whereas students who were now present during the research were chosen as respondents.</p>
			  <p><strong>RESEARCH INSTRUMENT</strong></p>
			  <p>The instrument researchers are going to use survey questionnaire, they are going to distribute the survey questionnaire through the use of google forms. The first part of the serving questionnaire is about the profile of the respondents and to the second part the researchers will use a Contingency questionnaire that has a set of 10 questions.</p>
			  <p><strong>DATA GATHERING PROCEDURE</strong></p>
			  <p>Before distributing the survey questionnaires, the researchers will consult the research teacher if the survey questionnaires are enough or there are still need to be changed, and second, after consulting with the research teacher, the researchers must also consult the English teacher so the English teacher can check if the sentence structure of survey questionnaires are correct or there is a sentence that must be fixed, and after consulting to two teachers the researchers must ask the research teacher if they can now collect data from the respondents, and after giving us a go we plan on collecting data from the respondents as soon as possible, collecting data from the respondents might take one week to complete all the numbers needed for gathering the data from the respondents.</p>
			  <p><strong>STATISTICAL TREATMENT OF DATA</strong></p>
			  <p><strong>Sample Mean </strong>– The mean refers to the average of a given set of data. This is obtained by adding all the data and dividing it by the number of the set.</p>
			  <p><img src="F1.PNG"></p>
			  <p><strong>Pearsons r </strong>– the Pearson correlation coefficient also known as Pearsons r, the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient, the bivariate correlation, or colloquially simply as the correlation coefficient, is a measure of linear correlation between two sets of data. The researchers have decided to use the Pearsons r to measure the statistical relationship between the two variable.</p>
			  <p><img src="F2.PNG"></p>
			  <p><strong>testing the significance of r </strong>- tells us about the strength and direction of the linear relationship between x and y. </p>
